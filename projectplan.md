**Objective**: Replace localStorage with complete database persistence for teams and brackets

#### Changes Made:
1. **Team Service Integration**
   - Created comprehensive TeamService with full CRUD operations
   - Implemented `createTeamsBulk()` method for saving multiple teams
   - Added `getTeamsByTournament()` for loading existing teams
   - Updated team generator component to use database instead of localStorage

2. **Bracket Service Database Integration** 
   - Added HttpClient injection to BracketService
   - Created `saveBracketToDatabase()` method 
   - Updated all bracket generation methods (single-elimination, double-elimination, round-robin) to persist to database
   - Replaced localStorage bracket storage with API calls

3. **Bracket Generator Component Updates**
   - Refactored `generateBracket()` method to handle async team loading for doubles tournaments
   - Added `proceedWithBracketGeneration()` helper method
   - Updated `viewBracket()` to navigate with tournament ID instead of localStorage
   - Added proper error handling when teams are not found

4. **Doubles Tournament Fix**
   - **Problem**: 8 players were generating 8 individual matches instead of 4 team matches
   - **Solution**: Bracket generation now loads teams from database first for doubles tournaments
   - **Result**: 8 players → 4 teams → 4 team matches (correct doubles tournament flow)

5. **TypeScript Compilation Fixes**
   - Fixed missing `isRegistered` property in Player objects when converting database teams
   - Added `isRegistered: true` to team mapping functions
   - Resolved all compilation errors in team generator component

#### Technical Impact:
- **Files Modified**: 4 key files (bracket-generator.component.ts, bracket.service.ts, team.service.ts, team-generator.component.ts)
- **localStorage Elimination**: Complete removal of browser storage dependencies
- **Database Persistence**: All tournament data now properly persists across sessions
- **Code Simplicity**: Changes were minimal and focused, impacting only necessary components

#### Testing Results:
- ✅ Teams save successfully to database via `/api/teams/bulk`
- ✅ Brackets save successfully to database via `/api/brackets` 
- ✅ Doubles tournaments correctly show 4 team matches for 8 players
- ✅ TypeScript compilation passes without errors
- ✅ Complete flow: team generation → database save → bracket generation → database bracket save

### Next Priority Recommendations:
Based on current state and claude.md simplicity principles, logical next steps would be:

#### Immediate Next Steps (High Priority):
1. **Complete Authentication Route Guards** (Phase 2.3) - Small, focused change
2. **Implement Match Scheduling System** (Phase 4.1) - Core tournament functionality
3. **Add Bracket Navigation Features** (Phase 3.3) - Enhance existing bracket system

#### Medium Term Goals:
4. **Tournament Results & Rankings** (Phase 4.3) - Complete tournament lifecycle
5. **UI/UX Polish** (Priority Enhancements) - Improve user experience
6. **Mobile Responsiveness** - Ensure cross-device compatibility

All recommendations follow simplicity principles with minimal code changes and focused improvements.
